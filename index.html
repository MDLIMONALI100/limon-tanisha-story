      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p>On the 15th of March 2025, in a simple group chat, two souls quietly crossed paths. There was no sign of what was to come‚Äîno dramatic beginning, no special spark. But Limon noticed her. And over time, through short texts, shared moments, and long silences, Tanisha began to mean something to him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <h2>Something Grew</h2>
      <p>Their bond was fragile at first. Unsure. But something grew. Limon didn‚Äôt fall in love the usual way. It was quiet. Slow. She became important because of the way he saw her. He gave her meaning. And that made her special.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <h2>Tanisha‚Äôs Kind of Love</h2>
      <p>Tanisha was protective, emotional, raw. She trusted Limon deeply. When she was in pain, crying through her period, she called Limon. And he stayed. Just listening. That moment made Limon feel truly loved.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <h2>Love Isn‚Äôt Easy</h2>
      <p>There were moments she wanted to walk away. But Limon didn‚Äôt let go. He held her with his words. That fear of losing her turned into guilt.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry">
      <h2>The Final Night</h2>
      <p>The night of heartbreak was quiet. Just soft ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù ‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù Even in goodbye, they chose kindness.</p>

      <h2>What Now?</h2>
      <p>Limon doesn‚Äôt know what the future holds. Whether they end up together or not, he prays Allah blesses them both. Because what they had‚Äîwas real. A love not loud, but true. A love not perfect, but pure.</p>
